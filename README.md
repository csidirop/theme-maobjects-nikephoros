# Omeka Classic theme for MAObjects

This theme is based on the [MAObjects](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/theme-maobjects) theme, which itself is based on the [Center Row](https://github.com/omeka/theme-centerrow) theme.

It is used by the [Mannheim University Library](https://www.bib.uni-mannheim.de) in the context of [MAObjects](https://www.bib.uni-mannheim.de/en/teaching-and-research/research-data-center-fdz/services-of-the-fdz/maobjects/) Omeka deployments to provide a theme in the corporate design of the [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/). MAObjects is a service of the Mannheim University Library that provides researchers with an Omeka-based platform to create and present digital object collections and virtual exhibitions by uploading digital objects, describing them with standardised metadata, and making the data available via an API.

- **Very customizable:** Optional advanced site-wide search, ability to route or hide the quick search bar, and show/hide child pages in top navigation.
- **Customizable homepage:** Featured item/collection/exhibit, intro text, optional slideshow with autoplay and speed, optional “floating” minimal homepage layout, and toggleable breadcrumbs.
- **Item and media display controls:** Multiple user-selectable layout options. Optional Lightgallery support (including PDFs via PDF Embed), handling of non-image media, configurable media captions, options to hide headings/DC title, and show/hide citations.
- **Collection views:** Configurable collection browse page style (e.g. grid/list) and options to hide headings/duplicate title entries on collection pages.
- **Background image options:** Site-wide background image with control over position, repeat, size, and whether it appears beneath the main content area.
- _much more...!_

### Additions to MAObjects:

One of the main changes to the MAObjects theme is the specialised 'Item Browse' view, which focuses on bibliographic results. The table list view from the [AvantSearch](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/AvantSearch/) plugin has been adapted to fit the theme's design and is now the default view for browsing items. This makes it easier to quickly scan through large bibliographic collections.
The advanced AvantSearch is also perfectly suited to bibliographic collections, as it allows for complex queries and filtering options.

- **Works best with following plugins:**
    - [AvantSearch](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/AvantSearch/) (for advanced site-wide search functionality and the great table list view!) <sup>[original repo](https://github.com/gsoules/AvantSearch)</sup>
    - [Search By Metadata](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/SearchByMetadata/) (to enhance search capabilities)
- **Updates or changes apperence of following plugins:**
    - [Corrections](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/Corrections/) (styling and function -> we are using it to gather user submitted tag suggestions) <sup>[original repo](https://github.com/patrickmj/Corrections/tree/v1.0), [updated repo](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/Corrections/tree/ubma)</sup>
    - [Search By Metadata](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/SearchByMetadata/) (to enhance search capabilities)
    - AvantSearch (Updated styling, added (optional) searchbar) <sup>[updated repo](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/AvantSearch/tree/nikephoros)</sup>
