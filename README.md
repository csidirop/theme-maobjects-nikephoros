# Omeka Classic theme for MAObjects

This theme is based on the [MAObjects](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/theme-maobjects) theme, which itself is based on the [Center Row](https://github.com/omeka/theme-centerrow) theme.

_This is a heavy customizable Omeka Classic theme for MAObjects, built to present digital collections, objects, and virtual exhibitions in the University of Mannheim’s visual design._

It is used by the [Mannheim University Library](https://www.bib.uni-mannheim.de) in the context of [MAObjects](https://www.bib.uni-mannheim.de/en/teaching-and-research/research-data-center-fdz/services-of-the-fdz/maobjects/) Omeka deployments to provide a theme in the corporate design of the [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/). MAObjects is a service of the Mannheim University Library that provides researchers with an Omeka-based platform to create and present digital object collections and virtual exhibitions by uploading digital objects, describing them with standardised metadata, and making the data available via an API.

- **Built for research collections and digital exhibitions:**
    - Designed for deployments that present digital objects, curated collections, and virtual exhibits in a polished University of Mannheim look (but not limited to!).
- **Flexible branding and homepage setup:**
    - Configure logo, logo text, header image, a configurable CI-style footer with uploaded logos and editable link blocks, colors, breadcrumbs, background image, and a homepage with intro text plus featured item, collection, or exhibit blocks.
- **Configurable navigation and search:**
    - Show or hide child pages in the top navigation, switch the quick search behavior, or expose Omeka's advanced site-wide search for more targeted discovery.
- **Stronger item and collection presentation:**
    - Choose [grid or list browse views][items_browse_style], [switch item-page layouts][items_page_layout], control headings and duplicate title output, and decide how citations and secondary navigation are shown. Additionally, the item tags page includes a search bar to filter the tag cloud by search query.
- **Better media handling out of the box:**
    - Support single- or multi-file items, choose media sizes and captions, surface non-image files more gracefully, and *optionally* use Lightgallery with PDF Embed integration for PDF viewing.
- **Plugin-aware theme refinements:** 
    - Includes dedicated support for [Exhibit Builder](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/ExhibitBuilder/) content and additional theme styling for [maintenance pages](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/AdminTools/) and other site states.
